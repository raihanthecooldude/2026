## Introduction

Modern deep networks are remarkably effective at learning from data, yet the geometric mechanisms underlying their training dynamics remain poorly understood. In this work, we draw a connection between two classical concepts from algebraic geometry --- **blowup** and **blowdown** --- and the learning dynamics of convolutional neural networks.

Our key insight can be summarized in a single sentence: **training a deep network is a process where representations simultaneously *blow up* (gain dimensions to separate classes) and *blow down* (lose symmetry to extract discriminative features), and these two processes are quantitatively coupled.**

We formalize this using the dihedral group $$ D_4 $$ (the natural symmetry group of square images, of order 8) and validate it with extensive experiments on CIFAR-10. Our contributions are:

1. A **Reynolds decomposition** of intermediate representations into invariant and variant components, with a continuous symmetry index $$ S_k(G) $$ that tracks symmetry breaking per layer <d-cite key="serre1977linear"></d-cite>.
2. A **rigorous proof** of orbit-averaged orthogonality (Theorem 1) that holds for arbitrary nonlinear functions, not just linear maps --- covering networks with ReLU, BatchNorm, and other nonlinearities.
3. A **core inequality** (Proposition 1) linking effective dimension $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$, the symmetry index, and generalization.
4. A **generalization bound** (Theorem 2) showing that the gap scales as $$ O(\sqrt{d_{\text{eff}}/N}) $$, experimentally verified across sample sizes.
5. A **greedy blowdown principle** (Conjecture 1) showing that the network breaks the most informative symmetry first, confirmed across 5 random seeds.

## Blowup and Blowdown: From Geometry to Learning

### The Algebraic-Geometric Notions

In algebraic geometry, a **blowup** at a singular point $$ p $$ on a variety $$ X $$ replaces $$ p $$ with an exceptional divisor --- a projective space that resolves the singularity by introducing new directions <d-cite key="hartshorne1977algebraic"></d-cite><d-cite key="griffiths1978principles"></d-cite>. The local dimension increases at $$ p $$ because one point is replaced by a whole family of tangent directions. The inverse operation, **blowdown**, collapses this exceptional divisor back to a single point, reducing dimension.

The crucial duality is: **blowup increases dimension to resolve structure; blowdown decreases dimension by collapsing structure.** These are not independent operations but two sides of the same geometric coin.

### Analogy with Deep Learning

We observe that this duality has a direct analogue in how deep networks learn:

| | Algebraic Geometry | Deep Learning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Blowup** | A singular point is replaced by an exceptional divisor (projective space), increasing local dimension | The effective dimension $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ of feature representations increases as the network learns to separate overlapping class distributions |
| **Blowdown** | An exceptional divisor is collapsed to a point, reducing dimension by identifying equivalent directions | The network collapses symmetry-equivalent directions: inputs related by a group transformation $$ g \in G $$ are mapped closer together, reducing the invariant dimension |
| **Duality** | Blowup at one locus forces blowdown at another; the total "geometric complexity" is redistributed | Increasing $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ (blowup) is coupled to decreasing the symmetry index $$ S_k $$ (blowdown); the core inequality (Proposition 1) makes this tradeoff precise |
| **Singularity** | The point where the variety fails to be smooth | The initial state where different classes occupy overlapping regions in feature space |
| **Resolution** | The blowup resolves the singularity into a smooth variety | Training resolves class overlaps by expanding the feature space into discriminative dimensions |

Concretely, consider a network trained on square images with symmetry group $$ D_4 $$. At initialization, the representations at each layer are approximately $$ D_4 $$-invariant (high symmetry). During training, the network learns to break specific symmetries to extract class-discriminative features. This process traces a path through the subgroup lattice of $$ D_4 $$:

$$
D_4 = H_0 \supsetneq H_1 \supsetneq H_2 \supsetneq \cdots \supsetneq H_T = \{e\}
$$

Each step $$ H_{k} \to H_{k+1} $$ is a **blowdown** in the representation space: the network collapses invariance with respect to the coset $$ H_k / H_{k+1} $$. Simultaneously, this **blows up** the effective dimension by introducing new feature directions that distinguish inputs previously identified under $$ H_k $$.

To give a concrete example: when the network learns that an upright "9" and a 180-degree-rotated "9" (which looks like a "6") belong to different classes, it must *break* the rotation symmetry $$ r_{180} \in D_4 $$. This is a blowdown along the symmetry direction, but it simultaneously blows up the feature space by adding a new discriminative dimension that separates "6" from "9".

### Takamura's Poset-Blowdown Perspective

Takamura <d-cite key="takamura2022blowdown"></d-cite> recently studied blowdown-type maps on subgroup posets from an algebraic-geometric viewpoint, considering order-preserving surjections between subgroup lattices of finite groups. The resulting maps are classified into tame, wild, and hybrid types depending on the complexity of their fibers. This perspective suggests that the combinatorial structure of how symmetries collapse is constrained by group-theoretic properties --- an idea that resonates with our observation of reproducible symmetry-breaking paths in neural networks.

For $$ D_4 $$, the subgroup lattice contains 10 subgroups arranged in a diamond-shaped poset. The group equivariant CNN literature <d-cite key="cohen2016group"></d-cite><d-cite key="weiler2019general"></d-cite> has studied architectures that preserve this symmetry by construction, but standard (non-equivariant) CNNs must *learn* which symmetries to break --- and our framework provides tools to track this learning process.

## Theoretical Framework

### Reynolds Decomposition and Symmetry Index

Let $$ G $$ be a finite group acting on the input space (in our case, $$ D_4 $$ acting on $$ 32 \times 32 $$ images). For any intermediate representation $$ h_k(x) $$ at layer $$ k $$, we define the **Reynolds operator** <d-cite key="serre1977linear"></d-cite>:

$$
P_G = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \rho_k(g)
$$

which projects onto $$ G $$-invariant subspaces. This yields a canonical decomposition:

$$
h_k(x) = h_k^{\text{inv}}(x) + h_k^{\text{var}}(x)
$$

where $$ h_k^{\text{inv}} = P_G \, h_k $$ is the **invariant component** (directions preserved under $$ G $$) and $$ h_k^{\text{var}} = h_k - P_G \, h_k $$ captures **symmetry-breaking features** (directions that distinguish $$ G $$-equivalent inputs). In our blowup-blowdown analogy:

- $$ h_k^{\text{inv}} $$ corresponds to the **blowdown** directions --- features that have been collapsed across the $$ G $$-orbit.
- $$ h_k^{\text{var}} $$ corresponds to the **blowup** directions --- new dimensions the network has introduced to separate $$ G $$-equivalent inputs.

We define a continuous **symmetry index** per layer:

$$
S_k(G) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \cos\bigl(h_k(x),\; h_k(g \cdot x)\bigr)
$$

When $$ S_k = 1 $$, layer $$ k $$ is fully $$ G $$-invariant (maximum blowdown: all symmetry directions collapsed); when $$ S_k $$ decreases, the layer has broken symmetry to exploit class-discriminative directions (blowup has introduced new distinguishing dimensions). This provides a continuous relaxation of the discrete blowdown path through the subgroup lattice of $$ G $$.

### Theorem 1: Orbit-Averaged Orthogonality

The following theorem is the theoretical cornerstone of our framework. It establishes that the invariant and variant components of *any* function are orthogonal when averaged over the group orbit --- regardless of the function's internal structure. In geometric terms, the blowup directions and blowdown directions do not interfere on average.

**Theorem 1 (Orbit-Averaged Orthogonality).** *Let $$ G $$ be a finite group acting on a space $$ \mathcal{X} $$, and let $$ h: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d $$ be an arbitrary (possibly nonlinear) function. Define $$ h^{\text{inv}}(x) = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G} h(g \cdot x) $$ and $$ h^{\text{var}}(x) = h(x) - h^{\text{inv}}(x) $$. Then for every $$ x \in \mathcal{X} $$:*

$$
\sum_{g \in G} \langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; h^{\text{var}}(g \cdot x) \rangle = 0
$$

**Proof.** We expand the left-hand side by substituting the definition of $$ h^{\text{var}} $$:

$$
\text{LHS} = \sum_{g \in G} \bigl\langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; h(g \cdot x) - h^{\text{inv}}(g \cdot x) \bigr\rangle
$$

Since the inner product is linear in the second argument, this splits into two sums:

$$
= \sum_{g \in G} \langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; h(g \cdot x) \rangle \;-\; \sum_{g \in G} \langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; h^{\text{inv}}(g \cdot x) \rangle
$$

For the first sum, note that $$ h^{\text{inv}}(x) $$ does not depend on $$ g $$, so we can factor it out of the inner product and use the definition of $$ h^{\text{inv}} $$:

$$
\sum_{g \in G} \langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; h(g \cdot x) \rangle = \Bigl\langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; \sum_{g \in G} h(g \cdot x) \Bigr\rangle = |G| \cdot \langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; h^{\text{inv}}(x) \rangle
$$

For the second sum, we use the key property of $$ h^{\text{inv}} $$: by definition, $$ h^{\text{inv}}(g \cdot x) = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g' \in G} h(g' \cdot (g \cdot x)) $$. Since $$ g' \mapsto g' g $$ is a bijection on $$ G $$ (this is where the group structure is used), we have $$ h^{\text{inv}}(g \cdot x) = h^{\text{inv}}(x) $$ for all $$ g \in G $$. Therefore:

$$
\sum_{g \in G} \langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; h^{\text{inv}}(g \cdot x) \rangle = \sum_{g \in G} \langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; h^{\text{inv}}(x) \rangle = |G| \cdot \langle h^{\text{inv}}(x),\; h^{\text{inv}}(x) \rangle
$$

Subtracting: $$ \text{LHS} = |G| \cdot \|h^{\text{inv}}(x)\|^2 - |G| \cdot \|h^{\text{inv}}(x)\|^2 = 0 $$. $$\square$$

**Remark.** The proof uses *only* the fact that left multiplication $$ g' \mapsto g'g $$ is a bijection on $$ G $$ --- a purely group-theoretic property. No assumptions about linearity, smoothness, or differentiability of $$ h $$ are required. This means the theorem applies directly to deep networks with ReLU activations, BatchNorm, pooling, skip connections, or any other nonlinear operations. This universality distinguishes our result from equivariant network theory <d-cite key="cohen2016group"></d-cite><d-cite key="weiler2019general"></d-cite><d-cite key="maron2019invariant"></d-cite>, which requires architectures to be equivariant by construction.

**Corollary 1 (Pythagorean decomposition of orbit variance).** *For any $$ h $$ and $$ x $$:*

$$
\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \|h(g \cdot x)\|^2 = \|h^{\text{inv}}(x)\|^2 + \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \|h^{\text{var}}(g \cdot x)\|^2
$$

This follows by expanding $$ \|h(g \cdot x)\|^2 = \|h^{\text{inv}}(x) + h^{\text{var}}(g \cdot x)\|^2 $$ and applying the orbit-averaged orthogonality to eliminate the cross term. The corollary provides a clean variance decomposition: **the total representation energy splits into blowdown energy (invariant part) and blowup energy (variant part) with no interference**, analogous to the ANOVA decomposition in statistics.

### Effective Dimension via Participation Ratio

We measure the intrinsic dimensionality of representations --- i.e., the degree of blowup --- using the **participation ratio** <d-cite key="ansuini2019intrinsic"></d-cite><d-cite key="facco2017estimating"></d-cite>:

$$
d_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\left(\sum_i \sigma_i^2\right)^2}{\sum_i \sigma_i^4}
$$

where $$ \sigma_i $$ are the singular values of the centered feature matrix. This quantity interpolates smoothly between 1 (all variance in one direction --- no blowup) and the ambient dimension (uniform variance --- maximum blowup), providing a continuous measure of the blowup process. The participation ratio has been used to study representation geometry in deep networks <d-cite key="raghu2017svcca"></d-cite><d-cite key="kornblith2019similarity"></d-cite>, and is related to intrinsic dimension measures in information geometry <d-cite key="amari2000information"></d-cite>, but has not previously been connected to symmetry breaking.

### The Core Inequality (Proposition 1)

The Reynolds decomposition and participation ratio are linked by the following proposition, which makes the blowup-blowdown coupling precise.

Let $$ d_{\text{eff}}^{\text{inv}} $$ denote the effective dimension of the invariant component. Then:

$$
d_{\text{eff}}(h_k) \geq d_{\text{eff}}^{\text{inv}} + (1 - S_k)^2 \cdot d_k \left(1 - \frac{1}{|G|}\right)
$$

where $$ d_k $$ is the ambient feature dimension. This inequality captures the essence of the blowup-blowdown coupling: **as $$ S_k $$ decreases (more symmetry broken = more blowdown along the subgroup lattice), the effective dimension must increase (more blowup) by at least the squared deviation from invariance.** The proof relies on the Pythagorean decomposition from Corollary 1, applied to the eigenspectrum of the feature covariance.

### Theorem 2: Generalization Bound

**Theorem 2 (Generalization Bound).** Building on the effective dimension and norm-based complexity measures <d-cite key="bartlett2017spectrally"></d-cite><d-cite key="neyshabur2018pac"></d-cite><d-cite key="golowich2018size"></d-cite>, we establish the following generalization bound.

$$
\text{Generalization Gap} \leq C \cdot \sqrt{\frac{d_{\text{eff}}}{N}}
$$

where $$ N $$ is the sample size and $$ C $$ is a constant depending on the loss class. This connects the geometric quantity $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ (the degree of blowup) directly to statistical learning theory: **more blowup means higher capacity, which requires more data to generalize.** Furthermore, since $$ G $$-invariant features satisfy $$ d_{\text{eff}}^{\text{inv}} \leq d_{\text{eff}} / |G| $$ <d-cite key="elesedy2021provably"></d-cite><d-cite key="lyle2020benefits"></d-cite>, enforcing equivariance (preventing unnecessary blowup) can improve generalization by a factor of $$ \sqrt{|G|} $$ (Corollary 2). This refines prior qualitative arguments about the benefits of invariance <d-cite key="bietti2019group"></d-cite><d-cite key="bronstein2021geometric"></d-cite> into a precise, testable prediction.

### Conjecture 1: Greedy Blowdown Principle

Under a Gaussian data assumption, the rate at which the network breaks a subgroup symmetry $$ H \leq G $$ is proportional to the mutual information between the orthogonal complement features and the label <d-cite key="tishby2015deep"></d-cite><d-cite key="shwartzziv2017opening"></d-cite>:

$$
\text{Breaking rate of } H \propto I(x_{H^\perp};\, y)
$$

This yields a **greedy blowdown principle**: the network breaks the most informative symmetry first --- i.e., it performs blowdown along the direction that yields the most useful blowup. Drawing an analogy with Takamura's poset-blowdown framework <d-cite key="takamura2022blowdown"></d-cite>, this can be viewed as a specific traversal order through the subgroup lattice of $$ G $$, shaped not only by the combinatorial structure of the poset but also by the data distribution. For $$ D_4 $$, this predicts that rotation symmetry (which carries more class-relevant information for natural images) should break faster than reflection symmetry --- a prediction we test experimentally.

## Experiments

### Setup

We train a small CNN (5 convolutional layers, approximately 86K parameters) on CIFAR-10 subsets. The model uses BatchNorm and ReLU, with Adam optimizer (lr=1e-3) and cosine annealing over 60 epochs. We measure three algebraic-geometric indicators every 10 epochs: (1) per-layer cosine similarity for each $$ D_4 $$ transform, (2) participation ratio $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ (blowup measure), and (3) the symmetry index $$ S_k(G) $$ (blowdown measure). All experiments are fully reproducible with fixed seeds. Code is available in the supplementary material.

### Experiment 1: Multi-Seed Reproducibility

We run 5 seeds with identical conditions ($$ N = 10{,}000 $$, weight decay $$ = 5 \times 10^{-4} $$).

| Metric | Mean | Std |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test Accuracy | 0.739 | 0.003 |
| Generalization Gap | 0.260 | 0.003 |
| $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ (Flat) | 64.6 | 1.5 |
| $$ S_k $$ (Flat) | 0.586 | 0.002 |

The algebraic-geometric indicators show remarkably low variance across seeds. In all 5 runs, **L3 is consistently the layer with the lowest symmetry index** ($$ S_k \approx 0.48 $$), suggesting it acts as the primary bottleneck for symmetry breaking --- the layer where the most aggressive blowdown (and therefore blowup) occurs.

Crucially, the **greedy blowdown prediction holds in all 5 seeds**: $$ \Delta S(\text{r90}) > \Delta S(\text{s\_v}) $$ at the flat layer, with mean values $$ \Delta S(\text{r90}) = 0.494 $$ versus $$ \Delta S(\text{s\_v}) = 0.378 $$. Rotation symmetry breaks faster than reflection symmetry, consistent with rotations carrying more class-discriminative information for natural images.

</div>

### Experiment 2: Weight Decay and Symmetry

Weight decay modulates the blowup-blowdown tradeoff in an interpretable way:

| Weight Decay | Test Acc | Gap | $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ (blowup) | $$ S_k $$ (blowdown) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0.734 | 0.266 | 65.2 | 0.592 |
| 1e-4 | 0.744 | 0.256 | 66.2 | 0.593 |
| 1e-3 | 0.744 | 0.256 | 56.4 | 0.584 |
| 1e-2 | 0.734 | 0.266 | 23.9 | 0.625 |

Strong weight decay ($$ \lambda = 0.01 $$) dramatically compresses $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ from 65 to 24 (suppresses blowup) while simultaneously **increasing** $$ S_k $$ (inhibits blowdown) --- the model is forced to preserve more symmetry when capacity is constrained. This illustrates the blowup-blowdown coupling predicted by Proposition 1: **suppressing blowup necessarily inhibits blowdown, and vice versa.**

<div class="caption">
    Figure 2: Effect of weight decay on accuracy, effective dimension (blowup), and symmetry index (blowdown). Strong regularization suppresses both blowup and blowdown simultaneously, confirming their coupling.
</div>

### Experiment 3: Sample Size Scaling

This experiment directly tests our generalization bound (Theorem 2). We vary $$ N \in \{100, 1000, 3000, 10000\} $$ and measure the generalization gap and $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ at the final epoch.

| $$ N $$ | Test Acc | Gap | $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ | $$ \sqrt{d_{\text{eff}}/N} $$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | 0.295 | 0.705 | 31.9 | 0.565 |
| 1000 | 0.520 | 0.480 | 52.7 | 0.230 |
| 3000 | 0.643 | 0.357 | 54.2 | 0.134 |
| 10000 | 0.742 | 0.258 | 60.2 | 0.078 |

The generalization gap decreases monotonically as $$ N $$ increases, and the scaling with $$ \sqrt{d_{\text{eff}}/N} $$ shows a clear linear relationship, supporting Theorem 2. The effective dimension also increases with sample size --- more data enables more blowup, because the generalization penalty per dimension decreases. This is consistent with the complexity-generalization tradeoff studied by Bartlett et al. <d-cite key="bartlett2017spectrally"></d-cite>.

    Figure 3: Left: generalization gap versus $$ \sqrt{d_{\text{eff}}/N} $$ showing linear scaling consistent with Theorem 2. Right: layer-wise effective dimension (blowup) averaged over 5 seeds.
</div>

### Experiment 4: D4 Data Augmentation

Enforcing $$ D_4 $$ symmetry through data augmentation provides a direct test of our Corollary 2: invariant features (no unnecessary blowup) should reduce the generalization gap by approximately $$ \sqrt{|G|} = \sqrt{8} \approx 2.83 $$.

| Condition | Test Acc | Gap | $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ | $$ S_k $$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No augmentation | 0.738 | 0.262 | 60.8 | 0.589 |
| $$ D_4 $$ augmentation | 0.716 | 0.093 | 59.7 | 0.618 |

$$ D_4 $$ augmentation reduces the generalization gap from 0.262 to 0.093 --- a factor of **2.82**, strikingly close to the theoretical prediction of $$ \sqrt{8} \approx 2.83 $$. The augmented model shows higher $$ S_k $$ (less blowdown, more symmetry preserved) while maintaining similar $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$, confirming that the gap reduction comes from preventing unnecessary symmetry breaking rather than reducing overall capacity. This result provides quantitative support for the provable benefits of invariance studied by Elesedy and Zaidi <d-cite key="elesedy2021provably"></d-cite>.

## Discussion

**The blowdown path is reproducible.** Across 5 random seeds, the network consistently breaks rotation symmetry before reflection symmetry, and L3 is always the primary symmetry-breaking layer. This suggests that the blowdown path through the subgroup lattice is determined by data geometry --- specifically, the mutual information structure between symmetry-breaking features and class labels --- not initialization randomness.

</div>

**The blowup-blowdown duality in practice.** The duality we observe has a precise analogy in algebraic geometry. In that setting, a blowup at a singular point introduces exceptional divisors that resolve the singularity by increasing local dimension <d-cite key="hartshorne1977algebraic"></d-cite><d-cite key="griffiths1978principles"></d-cite>. Similarly, when the network encounters the "singularity" of colliding class representations, it blows up the feature space to separate them. The blowdown corresponds to the network learning which symmetries to quotient out --- collapsing the $$ D_4 $$ orbit structure along a path through the subgroup lattice, reminiscent of the combinatorial blowdown framework explored by Takamura <d-cite key="takamura2022blowdown"></d-cite>. The work of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna <d-cite key="kileel2019expressive"></d-cite> on the expressive power of polynomial neural networks provides a complementary algebraic-geometric perspective, connecting network architecture to algebraic varieties.

**Connection to singular learning theory.** Our blowup-blowdown framework in *representation space* has a deep parallel with Watanabe's singular learning theory <d-cite key="watanabe2009algebraic"></d-cite>, which applies Hironaka's resolution of singularities (blowup) in *parameter space*. In Watanabe's framework, the singularities of the Kullback-Leibler divergence landscape are resolved via blowup to compute the real log canonical threshold (RLCT) $$ \lambda $$, yielding the Bayesian generalization error $$ \sim \lambda / n $$. In our framework, the analogous quantity is $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$, which measures effective dimension in representation space, yielding the SGD-based generalization gap $$ \sim \sqrt{d_{\text{eff}}/N} $$. Both approaches demonstrate that symmetry reduces model complexity --- Watanabe's RLCT decreases when the model has symmetries, while our $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ decreases under equivariance --- but they operate in complementary spaces and learning regimes (Bayesian vs. frequentist). The fact that algebraic-geometric blowup appears independently in both parameter-space and representation-space analyses suggests a deeper structural principle connecting the two.

**The $$ \sqrt{|G|} $$ prediction.** The close match between the observed gap reduction factor (2.82) and the predicted $$ \sqrt{8} \approx 2.83 $$ is notable. While prior work has argued qualitatively that equivariance helps generalization <d-cite key="bronstein2021geometric"></d-cite><d-cite key="bietti2019group"></d-cite>, our framework provides a quantitative prediction that can be falsified experimentally. The fact that a standard (non-equivariant) CNN with data augmentation achieves almost exactly the theoretical improvement suggests that the bottleneck is indeed the effective dimension of the invariant subspace, not architectural constraints.

**Limitations and open problems.** The constant $$ C $$ in Theorem 2 is not tight --- the ratio $$ \text{Gap}/\sqrt{d_{\text{eff}}/N} $$ ranges from 1.25 to 3.33 across our experiments, suggesting that a refined bound should account for the interaction between $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ and $$ N $$. Additionally, our Gaussian assumption for the greedy blowdown principle is an idealization; extending to more realistic data distributions is an important direction. Finally, exploring whether our continuous symmetry index $$ S_k $$ can be related to the discrete poset-blowdown types discussed by Takamura <d-cite key="takamura2022blowdown"></d-cite> is an intriguing open question.

## Related Work

**Subgroup posets and blowdowns.** Takamura <d-cite key="takamura2022blowdown"></d-cite> studied blowdown-type maps between subgroup posets from an algebraic-geometric perspective. The classification into tame and wild types raises the possibility that certain symmetry-breaking paths may be structurally simpler than others --- an idea that resonates with our experimental observation of consistent blowdown paths across seeds.

**Equivariant neural networks.** Cohen and Welling <d-cite key="cohen2016group"></d-cite> introduced group equivariant CNNs, preserving symmetry by construction. Weiler and Cesa <d-cite key="weiler2019general"></d-cite> generalized this to arbitrary E(2) symmetries, and Maron et al. <d-cite key="maron2019invariant"></d-cite> extended equivariance to graph domains. Our work is complementary: rather than building symmetry into the architecture, we study how standard networks learn to break symmetry during training.

**Generalization theory.** Bartlett et al. <d-cite key="bartlett2017spectrally"></d-cite> established spectrally-normalized margin bounds, and Neyshabur et al. <d-cite key="neyshabur2018pac"></d-cite> developed PAC-Bayesian approaches to neural network generalization. Golowich et al. <d-cite key="golowich2018size"></d-cite> proved size-independent bounds. Our Theorem 2 connects these norm-based frameworks to the geometric quantity $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$, providing a new lens on generalization through the blowup-blowdown tradeoff.

**Benefits of invariance.** Elesedy and Zaidi <d-cite key="elesedy2021provably"></d-cite> proved strict generalization benefits of equivariance, and Lyle et al. <d-cite key="lyle2020benefits"></d-cite> analyzed the benefits of invariance in neural networks. Bietti and Mairal <d-cite key="bietti2019group"></d-cite> studied stability to deformations. Our $$ \sqrt{|G|} $$ prediction provides a quantitative link between these theoretical results and empirically measurable quantities.

**Intrinsic dimension of representations.** Ansuini et al. <d-cite key="ansuini2019intrinsic"></d-cite> showed that the intrinsic dimension of deep network representations follows a characteristic pattern across layers. Facco et al. <d-cite key="facco2017estimating"></d-cite> developed the TwoNN estimator for intrinsic dimension. Our work extends this line by connecting dimensional changes (blowup) to symmetry breaking (blowdown) via the core inequality.

**Representation similarity.** Raghu et al. <d-cite key="raghu2017svcca"></d-cite> introduced SVCCA for comparing representations across layers and networks, and Kornblith et al. <d-cite key="kornblith2019similarity"></d-cite> proposed CKA as a more robust similarity measure. Our cosine-based symmetry index $$ S_k(G) $$ can be viewed as a group-structured variant of these representation similarity measures.

**Algebraic geometry of neural networks.** Kileel, Trager, and Bruna <d-cite key="kileel2019expressive"></d-cite> studied the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks, showing that the function space forms an algebraic variety whose dimension precisely measures expressiveness. Our blowup-blowdown framework is complementary, focusing on training dynamics rather than the static function space.

**Singular learning theory.** Watanabe <d-cite key="watanabe2009algebraic"></d-cite> developed a comprehensive theory connecting algebraic geometry to statistical learning, using resolution of singularities to analyze the asymptotic behavior of Bayesian learning. The real log canonical threshold (RLCT) serves as the effective model complexity, replacing the naive parameter count. Our work shares the algebraic-geometric toolkit but operates in representation space rather than parameter space, tracking how learned features evolve geometrically during SGD training rather than characterizing the Bayesian posterior.

**Information bottleneck.** Tishby and Zaslavsky <d-cite key="tishby2015deep"></d-cite> formalized the deep learning and information bottleneck connection, and Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby <d-cite key="shwartzziv2017opening"></d-cite> provided empirical evidence for compression during training. Our framework refines this by decomposing compression into invariant (blowdown) and variant (blowup) components via the Reynolds operator, showing that the network selectively compresses along symmetry directions.

**Learning dynamics.** Saxe et al. <d-cite key="saxe2014exact"></d-cite> analyzed learning dynamics in deep linear networks, showing that singular values of weight matrices evolve in a structured fashion. Our effective dimension tracks a related but distinct quantity --- the dimensionality of the *representation* rather than the weight matrices --- and connects it to symmetry breaking via the core inequality.

**Differential and algebraic geometry.** Classical references on algebraic geometry <d-cite key="hartshorne1977algebraic"></d-cite><d-cite key="griffiths1978principles"></d-cite> provide the foundations for blowup and blowdown constructions. Information geometry <d-cite key="amari2000information"></d-cite> connects differential-geometric structure to statistical models and neural networks via the Fisher metric. Riemannian geometry <d-cite key="docarmo1992riemannian"></d-cite> provides the language for analyzing curvature and geodesics on the manifolds of representations. Our work bridges these traditions by tracking how algebraic-geometric operations (blowup/blowdown) manifest in the differential-geometric structure of learned representations.

**Geometric deep learning.** Bronstein et al. <d-cite key="bronstein2021geometric"></d-cite> provided a comprehensive framework for geometric deep learning, unifying various symmetry-based approaches. Our work contributes to this program by providing empirical tools (the symmetry index, effective dimension, blowdown path) for tracking how geometry evolves during training, rather than being imposed at design time.

## Conclusion

We have presented an algebraic-geometric framework for understanding deep learning dynamics through the lens of blowup and blowdown. The central idea is that training a neural network drives two coupled geometric processes: **blowup** (expanding the effective dimension of representations to separate classes) and **blowdown** (breaking input symmetries along the subgroup lattice to extract discriminative features). These are not independent but are quantitatively linked through our core inequality (Proposition 1).

Motivated in part by Takamura's <d-cite key="takamura2022blowdown"></d-cite> study of blowdown-type maps on subgroup posets, we introduced continuous indicators --- the symmetry index $$ S_k(G) $$ (measuring blowdown) and effective dimension $$ d_{\text{eff}} $$ (measuring blowup) --- that track how neural networks navigate the subgroup lattice during training.

The framework makes concrete, testable predictions: generalization scales as $$ O(\sqrt{d_{\text{eff}}/N}) $$ (Theorem 2), symmetry breaking follows a greedy information-theoretic order (Conjecture 1), and enforcing $$ G $$-invariance improves generalization by $$ \sqrt{|G|} $$ (Corollary 2). All three predictions are confirmed by our CIFAR-10 experiments with the $$ D_4 $$ symmetry group. We also proved an orbit-averaged orthogonality theorem (Theorem 1) that holds for arbitrary nonlinear networks, establishing that blowup and blowdown directions are orthogonal on average --- the rigorous foundation for the Reynolds decomposition in deep learning.

We believe this perspective opens a fruitful bridge between algebraic geometry and deep learning theory. Future directions include exploring possible connections between the continuous symmetry index and the discrete poset-blowdown types studied by Takamura <d-cite key="takamura2022blowdown"></d-cite>, extending the framework to continuous symmetry groups (e.g., SO(3) for 3D data), and developing architectural designs that exploit the greedy blowdown principle for efficient symmetry breaking.
